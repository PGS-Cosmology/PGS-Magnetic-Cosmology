## Public Orientation Snapshot

**Year:** 2025  
**Cycle Marker:** DR9  
**Status:** Completed Cycle · Orientation Seed

This repository contains a public snapshot marking the completion of a development cycle within the framework currently referred to as **09 Magnetic Cosmology**.

The materials presented here are preserved as an orientation layer and research archive.  
They are not intended as a finalized theory, consensus model, or explanatory textbook.

Further work continues in the next cycle.

## Orientation Note

Modern scientific frameworks often increase descriptive precision while losing directional coherence.  
Observable physical phenomena — such as tilt, rotation, polarity reversal, and cyclic drift — are commonly treated as isolated effects distributed across extended entropic timelines.

A magnetic perspective does not introduce new data.  
It reorients observation.

What appears contradictory when sliced perpendicularly becomes coherent when followed by direction and duration.  
The distinction lies not in belief, authority, or interpretation, but in orientation.

## Repository Scope

This snapshot contains foundational research modules, conceptual investigations, and structural proposals developed prior to and during the 2025 (DR9) cycle.

- The archive is intentionally non-linear.
- Modules are preserved in their original sequence.
- Not all documents are introductory.
- Not all material is intended for general audiences.

This repository functions as a **public evaluation archive**, not a discussion forum.

---

## Status

This snapshot is intentionally stable.

- No further edits are planned for this cycle.
- Clarifications, expansions, and refinements occur in subsequent cycles.
